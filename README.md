Hi there! 
I'm Imran, a Computer Science student from Johor Bahru, Malaysia.

I'm primarily interested in full-stack development, video games development and especially machine learning.

Outside of school, I'm interested in following the developments of science. I also play a lot of video games.

I am also very much interested in the hardware side of IT such Servers and Networks.

Let's connect!
