        Zangetsu (斬月, Slaying Moon) is the manifested spirit of Ichigo Kurosaki's Zanpakutō as well as his inner Hollow. He has been variously called Hollow Ichigo (虚ホロウ一護, Horō Ichigo),
more properly called The Hollow within Ichigo (一護の内面の虚ホロウ, Ichigo no naimen no Horō) or White Ichigo (白一護, Shiro Ichigo).
Zangetsu is the result of the fusion between the Hollow White that Ichigo inherited from his mother and the Shinigami powers he inherited from his father.
