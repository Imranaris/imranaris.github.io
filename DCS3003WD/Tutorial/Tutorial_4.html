A <strong style="font-family: Livingston; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; 
font-size: larger;"> shepherd</strong> 
boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields 
near the forest. He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.
</p><br>

<p>
One day while <u>grazing</u> the sheep, he shouted, 
"Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is carrying away a lamb!"
Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for help but 
didn't find any wolf.
</p><br>

<p>
The boy laughed and replied, 
"It was just fun. There is no wolf here. 
<b style="font-size: 24px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The boy played a similar trick repeatedly for many days.</b>
</p><br>

<p>
After some days, while the shepherd boy was in the field with the herd of sheep, 
suddenly, a wolf came out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs. 
The boy was frightened and cried loudly, "Wolf! Wolf!"
<strike>The wolf is carrying the lamb away!</strike>

<span style="color: #55407e; font-size: 24px; font: weight 600px;">
The farmers <sup>thought</sup> the boy was playing <sub>mischief</sub> again.
</span> So, no one paid attention to him and didnâ€™t come to his help.
