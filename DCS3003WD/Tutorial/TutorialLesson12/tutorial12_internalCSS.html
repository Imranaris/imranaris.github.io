        <p>White (ホワイト, Howaito) is an experimental Hollow used by Sōsuke Aizen many years prior to his defection from Soul Society. It was created with the Souls of several Shinigami.
White is an almost completely black Hollow. It has a white mask and its light white hair reaches down to the middle of its back. It has two long, forward-pointing horns protruding 
from the sides of its head, and its Hollow hole, located in its upper chest, is red and filled in. It has two blades in place of its forearms.</p>

        <p>Zangetsu (斬月, Slaying Moon) is the manifested spirit of Ichigo Kurosaki's Zanpakutō as well as his inner Hollow. He has been variously called Hollow Ichigo (虚ホロウ一護, Horō Ichigo),
more properly called The Hollow within Ichigo (一護の内面の虚ホロウ, Ichigo no naimen no Horō) or White Ichigo (白一護, Shiro Ichigo).
Zangetsu is the result of the fusion between the Hollow White that Ichigo inherited from his mother and the Shinigami powers he inherited from his father.</p>
